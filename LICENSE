The files in this project are released under various licenses, all of
them compatible with the GPLv3.

The dependencies directory at the root of the project contains: a full
version of the GMP library; a full version of the MPFR library; and a
subpart of the Boost library (extracted with their internal tool
bcp). Licensing rules for the associated files are given directly in
the corresponding directories. GMP and MPFR are released under GPLv3
and Boost under Boost license which is compatible with GPLv3.

For the rest of the project files, most are released under the GPLv3
itself, but we reused some pieces of code sometimes, which are either
under a BSD license, or in the public domain. Outside of the
dependencies directory named above, the license for each file is given
at the beggining of the file.
